this is mostly about productivity tools, [obsidian](https://obsidian.md) in particular

i feel like most of these apps make you spend so much time creating the perfect workflow that by the time you're done (and you're never really done) you've wasted the time you wanted to use for something more important

i've been using obsidian for two days and all the extensions and the ways i can use obsidian through other things is already stressing me out
