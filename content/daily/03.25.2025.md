day 4 of vacation

doesn't feel like its been 4 days but i guess it has. bed bug bites are getting worse, but they gave me a new bed to use so hopefully that will be better. my cough has gotten worse too, it hurts to cough and to talk and even to burp

i found a new website, [venice.ai](https://venice.ai). i really like the landing page, the color scheme and the background video with the animations is really nice

finally watched wolf of wall street today, i wish they went more into the crimes and how they affected the victims

also i came to a realization today:
the way i started liking kiki was because she randomly appeared in my dream and i was basically inlove with her when i woke up. it was crazy that had never happened to me before lol. i probably liked her a bit before then but idk it was crazy. is this what happens when someone manifests about you? i always thought it was crazy but now im not so sure. anyways this is kind of reminding meof the book 'flipped,' which. i wanna read again or at least watch the movie.

i think thats it for today, im going to bed. goodbye!
