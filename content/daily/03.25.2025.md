day 4 of vacation

doesn't feel like its been 4 days but i guess it has. bed bug bites are getting worse, but they gave me a new bed to use so hopefully that will be better. my cough has gotten worse too, it hurts to cough and to talk and even to burp

i found a new website, [venice.ai](https://venice.ai). i really like the landing page, the color scheme and the background video with the animations is really nice

finally watched wolf of wall street today
