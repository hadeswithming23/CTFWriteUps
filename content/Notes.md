#### Question 1:
List the conjugate acid of the following:   
  a. HSO3 → H2SO3   
  b. H2O → H3O   
  c. SO4 → HSO4   
  d. NH3 → NH4   
  e. H2PO4 → H3PO4   
     

>[!NOTE]
>Base receives 1 Hydrogen(+) ion from the acid and becomes the conjugate acid   
>(Just add a hydrogen)   

       
List the conjugate base of the following:   
  a. HSO3 → SO3   
  b. H2O → OH   
  c. H2SO4 → HSO4   
  d. HF → F   
  e. H2PO4 → HPO4   
   
Acid donates one Hydrogen ion and becomes conjugate base   
(Remove a hydrogen)   
   
Sulfuric acid, H2SO4, is a Bronsted acid. Write the reaction that shows how H2SO4 acts as a Bronsted acid when it is in water. Label the acid, conjugate acid, base, and conjugate base in this reaction.   
   
  `H2SO4 + H2O ↔️ HSO4 + H3O`    
   
The hypofluorite ion, FO–, is a Bronsted base. Write the reaction that shows how the FO– ion acts as a Bronsted base when it is in water. Label the acid, conjugate acid, base, and conjugate base in this reaction.   
   
`FO + H2O ↔️ HFO + OH`    
   
Describe how a diagram would look with respect to the number of 
hydronium ions and hydroxide ions for the following scenarios:   
  1. pH<7 (acidic)      ⟶ More hydronium   
  2. pH=7 (neutral)    ⟶ Equal hydroxide and hydronium   
  3. pH>7 (basic)       ⟶ More hydroxide   
   
Consider the following 3 acids: HA, HB, and HC.  HA is the strongest acid and HC is the weakest acid.  How would you expect the concentrations of the acids and their dissociated ions to differ based on this information.  Now draw a bar chart representing the relative concentrations of the acid and its dissociated ions.   
   
Stronger acid = more dissociated (donated) hydrogen ions = more ion concentration
